# Technologies
This app uses Sass preprocessor for styling and Redux for state management. 

# Optimisation
As the app is quite small, in order to optimize the size, no libraries were used for styling. 

# Redux
In this particular app Redux is unnecessary and could be replaced with useReducer and useContext or even useState only. The decision to use Redux for state management was made for the following reasons:
1) To show that developer knows how to use Redux. 
2) In real life, this small app would become a part of a much bigger application (e.g. ecommerce store) and in this case Redux would be very necessary.
